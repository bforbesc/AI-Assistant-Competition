# Metrics Collection System Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to the metrics collection system.

## What Was Changed

1. **Fixed the user creation logic**
   - Ensures user records exist before tracking metrics
   - Prevents foreign key constraint errors

2. **Fixed page visit tracking**
   - Properly handles session state for tracking page entry/exit
   - Calculates and stores visit duration

3. **Added prompt metrics tracking**
   - Tracks word count and character count
   - Measures response time

4. **Simplified conversation metrics**
   - Removed user satisfaction tracking (was unused)
   - Focused on measurable metrics like duration and exchanges

5. **Made deal metrics more practical**
   - Made deal value optional
   - Ensures data is stored correctly

## How It Works

All metrics functions will:
1. Create necessary database tables if they don't exist
2. Ensure user records exist for foreign key relationships
3. Handle errors gracefully without crashing the app
4. Collect only what can be measured

## Integration

Most metrics functions are already integrated in the app:

- **Page visits**: Already tracked in all pages
- **Login tracking**: Already tracked at login
- **Game interactions**: Already tracked in game pages

For new metrics like prompt metrics, see `metrics_usage_examples.txt` for examples.

## The Metrics Collected

1. **Page visits**: Which pages users view, how long they stay
2. **Page visit count**: How often users return to each page
3. **Prompt metrics**: Length of prompts, response time
4. **User login**: First login, login frequency
5. **Conversation metrics**: Exchange count, conversation duration
6. **Deal metrics**: Success rate, negotiation rounds, optional values
