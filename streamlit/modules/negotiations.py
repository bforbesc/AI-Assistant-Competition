Key Requirements:
1. Analyze the ENTIRE conversation, not just the last few messages
2. Look for explicit agreement on a specific value from BOTH parties
3. Verify that the agreed value is consistent throughout the conversation
4. Check for confirmation messages from both parties
5. Ensure the negotiation follows a natural flow and reaches a legitimate conclusion
6. Consider the negotiation context and expected value ranges

To determine if there is a valid agreement:
- Both parties must explicitly agree on the same value
- The agreement must be confirmed by both parties
- The conversation must end naturally with {negotiation_termination_message}
- The agreement must be consistent with the negotiation context
- There must be no contradictions or retractions of the agreement

Your response format:
- If there is a valid agreement: '{summary_termination_message} [agreed_value]'
- If there is no valid agreement: '{summary_termination_message} -1'

Be thorough in your analysis and only report an agreement if ALL conditions are met."""

Key Requirements:
1. Analyze the ENTIRE conversation, not just the last few messages
2. Look for explicit agreement on a specific value from BOTH parties
3. Verify that the agreed value is consistent throughout the conversation
4. Check for confirmation messages from both parties
5. Ensure the negotiation follows a natural flow and reaches a legitimate conclusion
6. Consider the negotiation context and expected value ranges

To determine if there is a valid agreement:
- Both parties must explicitly agree on the same value
- The agreement must be confirmed by both parties
- The conversation must end naturally with {negotiation_termination_message}
- The agreement must be consistent with the negotiation context
- There must be no contradictions or retractions of the agreement

Your response format:
- If there is a valid agreement: '{summary_termination_message} [agreed_value]'
- If there is no valid agreement: '{summary_termination_message} -1'

Be thorough in your analysis and only report an agreement if ALL conditions are met."""
