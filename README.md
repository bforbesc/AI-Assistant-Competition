# AI-Assistant-Competition

This App was developed with the goal of creating a platform for students to create and train their own AI assistants (bots) to compete in various negotiation challenges. The project is part of the course AI Impact on Business at Nova SBE, and the initial focus is on negotiation games, such as variations of the Ultimatum Game or the Prisoner's Dilemma. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for students to design, train, and test their Assistants, as well as a leaderboard to track their performance.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

All of the step-by-step guides live in two places:

- **User Guide**  
  Detailed instructions for participantsâ€”account setup, bot development, submission workflow, sandbox testing, and leaderboard interpretationâ€”can be found in  
  `user_guide/README.md`.  

- **Developer Guide**  
  Everything a contributor needsâ€”DevContainer configuration, environment bootstrapping, database initialization, testing and contribution conventionsâ€”is documented in  
  `.devcontainer/README.md`.
